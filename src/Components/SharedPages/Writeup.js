          ᶿFor a limited time only, on Samsung.com and the Shop Samsung App, pre-order or purchase a new 
          qualifying Galaxy device (“Qualifying Purchase”), send in your qualifying trade-in device to Samsung 
          through the Samsung Trade-In Program, and if Samsung determines your trade-in device meets all
           eligibility requirements, you will receive a trade-in credit specific to your qualifying trade-in device
            to apply toward your Qualifying Purchase. Device models that currently qualify for trade-in and trade-in
             credit amounts associated with those models are available on Samsung.com and the Shop Samsung App; 
             eligible models and amounts may change at Samsung’s sole discretion. To be eligible for trade-in, 
             your qualifying device must meet all Trade-In Program eligibility requirements, which include, but
              are not limited to, that the device powers on, holds a charge, and does not power off unexpectedly; 
              has a functioning display; has no breaks or cracks in the screen (unless a cracked screen offer applies); 
              has no breaks or cracks in the case; has no liquid damage (whether visible or not); has no other defects 
              that go beyond normal wear and tear; is not on a black list; has a verified FCC ID; has been reset to 
              factory settings; has all personal information removed; has all software locks disabled; and is owned 
              by you (leased devices are not eligible). Anticipated trade-in value will be applied as a credit at time 
              of purchase, but, if you do not send in your trade-in device within 15 days of receipt of your Qualifying 
              Purchase, you will be charged back for the trade-in credit applied to your purchase, or if you send in your
               trade-in device within 15 days of receipt of your Qualifying Purchase but Samsung determines your device
                does not meet all eligibility requirements, you will be charged back for the trade-in credit applied to
                 your purchase minus $25. Participation in this program does not excuse you from contracts with your 
                 carrier or retailer (or any related payments or fees) for the device that was traded in. Limit 1 
                 trade-in per Qualifying Purchase. Samsung reserves the right to modify or discontinue this offer at
                  any time. The Trade-In Program cannot be combined with any other Samsung, carrier or retailer
                   promotions, discounts, or offers unless specifically provided for in the terms and conditions of 
                   such offers. Additional terms, 
          including terms that govern the resolution of disputes, apply. Click here to learn more.
